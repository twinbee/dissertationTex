%PURPOSE:      To demonstrate the generation of a dissertation for
%           for Scientific Computing and Mathematics at USM.
%
%APPROACH:     This uses modified class files based on book.cls files
%               to control the layout of the page for the majority of
%               the page appearance. Some commands are not hard coded
%               as macros in the style file. These must be entered
%               as shown in this example in order to produce a file which
%               is consistent with the requirments of the Graduate College.
%
%               You must also be aware of the rules that LaTeX uses to
%               set a page. This includes 1) each paragraph begins on a
%               newline after a blank line; 2) a word begins when at least
%               one blank space is left on a line (punctuation belongs
%               to the end of words, e.g.,  'this sentence ends. ' is
%               the way to type, not 'this sentence ends .'; 3) parentheses
%               belong to the words internal to the bracketed phrase,
%               e.g., 'this (while they said otherwise) and not those'
%               in contrast to 'this( while they said otherwise )and not those';
%               and, 4) remember to tie together objects with forced
%               spaces, thus 'Fig.~5' and not 'Fig. 5'. The detail
%               is important to getting TeX to interpret the spacing.

%+++++++++++++++++++++THIS VERSION IS SETUP TO RUN ON LINUX+++++++++++++++++++++

%
% You need to run teTeX (LaTeX2e) with the paths set correctly as
%TEXINPUTS=.:$HOME/common/defaults/latex/inputs//:/home/defaults/latex/inputs//:
%
% If you are at USM on any Scientific Computing workstation running  Linux,
% the setup of redhat linux should work without any additions modifations.

%++++++++++++++++++++++SETUP THE MARGINS AND SPACING++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

% THIS SETUP INCLUDES THE AMSLatex FONTS AND MACROS AND THE NEW graphicx PACKAGE
\documentclass[oneside,12pt]{dissertation_usm}
\usepackage{graphicx,amssymb,amsfonts,amsmath,amsthm,eucal}
% THE eucal package provides improved math caligraphic fonts.

% PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE FONT ENCODING.

%THIS ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE THE SCALE OF YOUR OUTPUT (THE UPPER LEFT CORNER
% IS HELD CONSTANT). DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU NEED TO SCALE YOUR OUTPUT.
% CHANGE THE \mag=VALUE command in the mag.sty FILE TO CHANGE THE SCALE.
%\mag=1000 IS NORMAL SCALING.
