Your broswer should be running before you attempt to use any of the html
commands. If it is not, the script will attempt to start netscape.
It is not always successful on the initial attempt.

If you are running on any of the Scientific Computing workstations
which have an installed Ebin directory (/usr/local/Ebin), if your path
is set to the directory you may use a similar, however more sophisticated
graphical user interface, Etextool. To use type

             Etextool

with no arguments (which gives you a list of commands to use). The
Etextool command also creates the files ERROR.DISSc containing a summary
of the error messages tex produced.
